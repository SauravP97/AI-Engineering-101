His approach is often described as a form of value investing, deeply rooted in principles of integrity and rational decision-making.

#### Core Tenets:

*   **Simplicity and Focus:** Yongping's philosophy centers on simplifying complexities and focusing on the core essence of a business. He advocates for understanding business models, products, and user needs rather than chasing trends or imitating others [cited_url: https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/18537661287098]. This involves selectively learning and focusing on one's own areas of interest and competence [cited_url: https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/18537661287098].

*   **Long-Term Perspective:** A crucial element of his strategy is to "do the right thing" by maintaining a long-term vision. He advises against focusing on immediate benefits and instead encourages considering the long-term impacts of every decision [cited_url: https://www.binance.com/en/square/post/18537661287098]. This aligns with his preference for holding on to a good company and maintaining a "normal mind" to differentiate between investment and speculation [cited_url: https://news.futunn.com/en/post/10036819/duan-yongping-s-investment-mindset-keep-a-normal-mind-and].

    1.  **"Do the right things, and do things right":** This underscores the importance of both strategy and execution.
    2.  **"No great ambition":** Yongping warns that the excessive pursuit of "great goals" can lead to a focus on quick success and risky strategies, potentially ignoring business rules and long-term stability [cited_url: https://tianpan.co/blog/2025-02-15-duan-yongping-three-core-business-ideas].
    3.  **"Be a person of integrity":** This is foundational to his approach, influencing both his business dealings and investment choices [cited_url: https://tianpan.co/blog/2025-02-15-duan-yongping-three-core-business-ideas].

 ## What is the investment philosophy of Warren Buffett?

Warren Buffett's investment philosophy is centered on the principle of value investing, viewing the purchase of a stock as acquiring a piece of a business. This approach requires an investor to think like a company owner rather than a stock trader [citation: https://www.iiflcapital.com/blog/personal-finance/lessons-from-warren-buffetts-investment-philosophy]. His strategy eschews market timing and forecasting, reflecting a deep skepticism about the predictions of Wall Street [citation: https://www.sfu.ca/~poitras/BUFFET.pdf]. Instead, he focuses on making educated investment decisions by thoroughly analyzing companies [citation: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp].

Key tenets of his philosophy include:

*   **Buying Businesses, Not Stocks:** Buffett's core principle is to invest in businesses, not just trade stocks. He is not primarily concerned with whether the market will soon recognize the company's worth [citation: https://www.investopedia.com/articles/01/071801.asp]. This long-term perspective requires an assessment of a business's value over five to ten years [citation: https://www.bankrate.com/investing/warren-buffett-profile/].
*   **The "Moat" Concept:** He conceptualizes a good business as a "castle" protected by a "moat," which represents a durable competitive advantage. His evaluation of management includes whether they are actively working to widen this moat [citation: https://hbr.org/1996/01/what-i-learned-from-warren-buffett].
*   **Focus on Productive Assets:** Buffett's advice is to invest only in productive assets. The value of these assets is derived from the future value of their cash flows, making a long-term assessment crucial [citation: https://www.bankrate.com/investing/warren-buffett-profile/].
*   **Price is Paramount:** A critical component of his strategy is the price paid for an investment. He believes that even the best business or manager cannot yield a great investment if the purchase price is too high [citation: https://www.bankrate.com/investing/warren-buffett-profile/]. He often sees low prices as a result of pessimism, which can be an opportunity for the rational investor [citation: https://www.sfu.ca/~poitras/BUFFET.pdf].
*   **Evolution of Philosophy:** Buffett's investment philosophy has evolved. Initially, he followed a strictly quantitative approach. Over time, he learned to look beyond just financial data to recognize the qualitative economic potential of "unique franchises," such as dominant newspapers, and the importance of management that can wisely invest the cash a good business generates [citation: https://hbr.org/1996/01/what-i-learned-from-warren-buffett]. This is evident in the transformation of Berkshire Hathaway from a textile business into a holding company that uses cash from its businesses to invest in others [citation: https://hbr.org/1996/01/what-i-learned-from-warren-buffett].

 
 ## What is the investment philosophy of Charlie Munger?


Charlie Munger's investment philosophy is a disciplined and patient approach centered on the principles of value investing, with a primary focus on acquiring high-quality businesses. His strategy integrates several key concepts to identify and hold investments for the long term.

A core tenet of his philosophy is to invest in companies when their market price is considerably below their intrinsic value [source: pictureperfectportfolios.com]. However, Munger evolved the traditional value investing approach by placing a strong emphasis on the quality of the business over its price. His belief is that "the real money is in great companies," making the focus on high-quality businesses a key to successful investing [source: yapss.com, pictureperfectportfolios.com].

Munger's methodology is built on four integrated principles:

1.  **Circle of Competence:** Munger advocated for investing only in areas that one understands thoroughly. An ideal investment opportunity is one that falls "well within your circle of competence" [source: pictureperfectportfolios.com].
2.  **Intrinsic Value:** He sought to purchase businesses whose underlying worth was significantly higher than their stock market valuation [source: pictureperfectportfolios.com].
3.  **Margin of Safety:** A crucial element is ensuring a "large margin of safety" when investing, which means buying a stock at a significant discount to its intrinsic value to protect against unforeseen problems and miscalculations [source: pictureperfectportfolios.com].
4.  **Concentration over Diversification:** Munger favored a concentrated portfolio of a few, high-conviction investments rather than broad diversification [source: pictureperfectportfolios.com].

Patience is a cornerstone of this philosophy. Munger believed in waiting for the perfect opportunity, which he termed the "fat pitch," a baseball analogy for an investment that meets all his strict criteria: it's within his circle of competence, has a high intrinsic value, and is offered with a large margin of safety [source: pictureperfectportfolios.com]. This patient but decisive approach has been fundamental to his enduring success as an investor.
