 ### What is the role of need for closure on misinformation acceptance?

The need for cognitive closure (NfCC), which describes an individual's desire for a firm answer to a question and an aversion to ambiguity, plays a significant role in the acceptance of misinformation. Research indicates that individuals with a high need for closure are more susceptible to believing and spreading false information, particularly in situations involving memory and uncertainty.

### **Impact on Eyewitness Memory and False Confessions**

A primary area where the influence of NfCC on misinformation is studied is eyewitness memory.

*   **Increased Susceptibility:** Studies show that a high need for cognitive closure is a determinant of susceptibility to misinformation. In one experiment, individuals with high NfCC who were presented with misinformation had a higher susceptibility score (mean of 1.84) compared to those with low NfCC (mean of 1.36) [https://arch.ies.gov.pl/images/PDF/2019/vol_118/118_Hejniak_m.pdf](https://arch.ies.gov.pl/images/PDF/2019/vol_118/118_Hejniak_m.pdf). This suggests that the desire for a clear, unambiguous narrative makes individuals more likely to accept and integrate false details into their memory.
*   **Cognitive Mechanisms:** The mechanism behind this involves retrieval-induced forgetting. Research published in *Social Cognition* demonstrates that a high NfCC enhances retrieval-induced forgetting, a process where remembering certain information causes the forgetting of other related details. This cognitive side-effect, in turn, magnifies the effects of misinformation in eyewitness accounts [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264342616_The_Role_of_Need_for_Cognitive_Closure_in_Retrieval-Induced_Forgetting_and_Misinformation_Effects_in_Eyewitness_Memory](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264342616_The_Role_of_Need_for_Cognitive_Closure_in_Retrieval-Induced_Forgetting_and_Misinformation_Effects_in_Eyewitness_Memory), [https://www.kruglanskiarie.com/the-need-for-closure-and-conservati](https://www.kruglanskiarie.com/the-need-for-closure-and-conservati).
*   **False Confessions:** The same study also examined NfCC as a factor in the proneness to false confessions, indicating a broader link between the need for closure and the acceptance of false narratives in forensic contexts [https://arch.ies.gov.pl/images/PDF/2019/vol_118/118_Hejniak_m.pdf](https://arch.ies.gov.pl/images/PDF/2019/vol_118/118_Hejniak_m.pdf).

### **Broader Implications**

The influence of NfCC on misinformation extends beyond eyewitness testimony.

*   **Uncertainty and Crisis:** During periods of high uncertainty, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for closure can drive people to accept misinformation as a way to resolve ambiguity and gain a sense of certainty [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9690611/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9690611/).
*   **Stereotypes and Information Discounting:** A high need for closure can lead to a pattern of discounting information that contradicts one's established beliefs. This cognitive shortcut helps maintain closure but can foster the formation of stereotypes and accelerate the spread of misinformation when it aligns with pre-existing conclusions [https://scc.sg/e/the-need-for-closure/](https://scc.sg/e/the-need-for-closure/).

In summary, a high need for cognitive closure acts as a vulnerability factor for misinformation acceptance. The strong desire to eliminate ambiguity can lead individuals to prematurely accept and defend information, even if it is false, particularly when their memory is suggestible or they are in a state of uncertainty.<ctrl42>call:ToolCode{code:
